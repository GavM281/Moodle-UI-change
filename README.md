# Moodle-UI-change
Small changes to the Moodle UI using the [Stylus browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search).

Main changes are:
* Reducing the height of the header which I thought was too tall. This also means the "Customise this page" button is now inline with the other header items.
* Rounding corners of buttons and cards.
* Changing spacing slightly.
